# KVCache.ai

Official website source for [KVCache.ai](https://kvcache.ai/) — the home of open-source projects and research on KV cache management and LLM serving optimization.

## About KVCache.ai

KVCache.ai advances the state of the art in Large Language Model (LLM) inference optimization. In decoder-only Transformer models, data from diverse modalities can ultimately be transformed into KV cache, making it a central component of modern LLM serving systems. As a result, KV cache has become a key focus for improving inference efficiency through techniques such as caching, scheduling, compression, offloading, and disaggregated serving architectures.

Through open-source projects and academic research, KVCache.ai develops effective, practical, and high-performance solutions for KV cache management and LLM serving optimization. The goal is to make LLM deployment more accessible, efficient, and cost-effective for organizations of all sizes.

### Featured Projects

- **[Mooncake](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake)** — A KV cache-centric disaggregated architecture for LLM serving.
- **[KTransformers](https://ktransformers.net/en)** — A CPU/GPU heterogeneous LLM inference and fine-tuning framework for running and tuning 100B+ models on accessible workstation hardware.
- **[TrEnv-X](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/TrEnv-X)** — An open-source runtime platform designed for AI Agent applications.

### Tools

- **[KV Cache Size Calculator](/tools/kv-cache-size-calculator/)** — Estimate KV cache capacity for common production LLM families, including DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi, Qwen, MiniMax, MiMo, and others.
- **[KV Cache Hit Rate Simulator](/tools/kv-cache-hit-rate-simulator/)** — Calculate KV cache hit rate of preset or your own trace, under different memory budgets.
